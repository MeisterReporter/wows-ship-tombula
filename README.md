# What do you need?
Only a modern Browser like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.

# How does it Work?
- On the Left side you have the Sidebar, in which you can select and filter the ships you want to pick from
- In the middle you have a blue button "Draw a Ticket", which will spin the Tombula underneath. Wait until its finished.
- If the tombula stopped spinning, a golden card should appear. In order to see what you got, take your mouse and scratch over the card.
- What you see there is a Ship from World of Warhsips, with the required information to find it in your port.
