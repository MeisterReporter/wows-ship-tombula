# What do you need?
Only a modern Browser like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.
CAUTION: Some Mobile browsers have issues with scratching the ticket. I recommend using the Website on Desktop/Notebook devices

# How does it Work?
- On the Left side you have the Sidebar, in which you can select and filter the ships you want to pick from
<div>

</div>
- In the middle you have a blue button "Draw a Ticket", which will spin the Tombula underneath. Wait until its finished.

- If the tombula stopped spinning, a golden card should appear. In order to see what you got, take your mouse and scratch over the card.
- What you see there is a Ship from World of Warhsips, with the required information to find it in your port.

# Whats up Next? / Bugs
- ✅**Making the Website responsive**
- ✅**Modify the Shipdata**: World of Warships does not distinguish between Light Cruisers, Heavy Cruisers and Battlecruisers, while the Ship Tombula does.
- Adding a feature which reads from the WoWs Numbers API which ships you have/had in port and select them when you click on a Button.
- Fixing Bugs if they occur

# Why is a Ship Missing?
- The data for the ships, must be updated manually. So if World of Warships gets a new Ship, the datat must be gathered and put into the datasheet. If the data is not yet available the ship will be missing.
